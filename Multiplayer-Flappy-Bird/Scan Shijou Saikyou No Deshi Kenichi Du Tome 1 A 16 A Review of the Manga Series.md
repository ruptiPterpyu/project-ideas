It was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday from 2002 to 2014, with a total of 61 volumes. It was also adapted into an anime series, an OVA series, and a video game.
 
In this article, we will review the first 16 volumes of the manga series, which cover the introduction of the main characters, the basic training arc, the Ragnarok arc, and the D of D tournament arc. We will also discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of the series, as well as its popularity and reception.
 
## The Plot
 
The story begins with Kenichi Shirahama, a weak and nerdy boy who loves reading books but has no friends or self-esteem. He is constantly bullied and harassed by his classmates, especially by members of the karate club. His life changes when he meets Miu Furinji, a beautiful and mysterious transfer student who saves him from a group of thugs. Miu invites Kenichi to her home, which turns out to be the Ryozanpaku dojo, where she lives with her grandfather Hayato Furinji and five other martial arts masters: Akisame Koetsuji (jujutsu), Shio Sakaki (karate), Apachai Hopachai (muay thai), Kensei Ma (kung fu), and Shigure Kosaka (weapons).
 
Kenichi is awed by their skills and personalities, but also terrified by their harsh and eccentric training methods. He decides to become their disciple in order to become stronger and protect Miu, who he develops a crush on. However, his decision also attracts the attention of various enemies who want to challenge him or use him for their own purposes. Some of these enemies include Ragnarok, a powerful delinquent gang led by Odin; Yomi, a group of elite disciples from an evil organization called Yami; and Yami itself, which seeks to spread chaos and violence through martial arts.
 
Throughout the series, Kenichi faces many battles and trials that test his courage, determination and loyalty. He also makes friends and allies with other martial artists who share his ideals or respect his spirit. He grows not only as a fighter but also as a person, learning valuable lessons from his masters and experiences.
 
## The Characters
 
One of the main attractions of the series is its large and diverse cast of characters, each with their own personality, background and fighting style. The main protagonist, Kenichi Shirahama, is a relatable and likable character who undergoes significant development throughout the series. He starts as a timid and weak boy who is afraid of everything but gradually becomes more confident and brave as he learns martial arts. He is also kind-hearted, loyal and humorous, often making funny expressions or comments in serious situations. He has a strong sense of justice and morality, always trying to help others and avoid unnecessary violence. He is also very respectful and grateful to his masters, whom he considers as his family.
 
The main heroine, Miu Furinji, is a beautiful and talented martial artist who is proficient in various styles. She is cheerful, friendly and caring, often helping Kenichi with his training or problems. She is also naive and innocent about some aspects of life due to her sheltered upbringing at Ryozanpaku. She has a close bond with her grandfather Hayato Furinji, who raised her after her parents disappeared. She is unaware of Kenichi's feelings for her at first but
