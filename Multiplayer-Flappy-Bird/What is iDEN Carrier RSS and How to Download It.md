iDEN Carrier RSS is a software program developed by Motorola that allows users to program and customize their iDEN phones. iDEN stands for Integrated Digital Enhanced Network, a wireless technology that combines voice, data, and push-to-talk services. iDEN phones are mainly used by Nextel customers in the US and other countries.

iDEN Carrier RSS can be used to change various settings on iDEN phones, such as network parameters, roaming indicators, phone features, and codeplugs. A codeplug is a file that contains the configuration data of the phone, such as frequencies, channels, encryption keys, etc. By modifying the codeplug, users can unlock hidden features, enable free services, or change the phone's behavior.
 
However, using iDEN Carrier RSS requires some technical knowledge and skills, as well as a special cable to connect the phone to the computer. Also, modifying the codeplug can potentially damage the phone or void its warranty. Therefore, it is not recommended for inexperienced or casual users to use iDEN Carrier RSS.
 
iDEN Carrier RSS is not publicly available from Motorola, but it can be obtained from some authorized dealers or online sources. There are different versions of iDEN Carrier RSS, such as SuperAgent, Depot, and LAB, which are designed for different purposes and have different features. The latest version of iDEN Carrier RSS is 2.1.2[^1^], which can be downloaded from [Software Informer](https://iden-carrier-rss.software.informer.com/). However, this version may not support some newer models of iDEN phones, such as i870 and i930[^2^]. Users should check the compatibility of their phones before downloading and using iDEN Carrier RSS.
  
To use iDEN Carrier RSS, users need to have a compatible data cable that can connect their iDEN phone to their computer. The cable may vary depending on the model of the phone, but it usually has a USB connector on one end and a mini-USB or micro-USB connector on the other end. Users can purchase the cable from Motorola or other online retailers.
 
After connecting the phone to the computer, users need to run iDEN Carrier RSS and select File > Read Phone. This will read the codeplug from the phone and display it on the screen. Users can then navigate through the different menus and submenus to change various settings and parameters. Some of the common settings that users may want to change are:
 
- Both Branding String: This is the text that appears on the phone's screen when it is turned on or off. Users can change it to any text they want, such as their name or a slogan.
- SMS Service Center: This is the phone number that the phone uses to send and receive text messages. Users can change it to match their carrier's SMS service center number.
- MMS Service Center: This is the web address that the phone uses to send and receive multimedia messages. Users can change it to match their carrier's MMS service center address.
- OAR Carrier Domain: This is the domain name that the phone uses to access online services, such as email, web browsing, or downloading ringtones. Users can change it to match their carrier's domain name.
- X-WAP Profile Header: This is the web address that identifies the phone's capabilities and features to websites. Users can change it to match their phone model and carrier.

After making the desired changes, users need to select File > Write Phone. This will write the modified codeplug back to the phone. Users should be careful not to disconnect the phone or turn off the computer during this process, as it may cause errors or damage to the phone. Users should also backup their original codeplug before making any changes, in case they need to restore it later.
